The parameters provided in the document are early results, intended solely for testing whether there are errors in the code. During training, you can try changing the number of vehicles for secondary training, as altering the number of vehicles will enable the agent to learn results in more complex channel occupancy situations. Finally, during our code testing, we actually found some unresolved issues. Firstly, the results obtained by automatically transitioning to the test phase during training were not as good as those obtained by directly running the test section. Secondly, after allocating actions to all vehicles, we observed that most of the time only 19 channels were occupied, which requires further analysis. Finally, thank you for your attention to our research. If you encounter any issues during replication or reference, please feel free to contact us via email, and we will explain our current work as clearly as possible.

文件中提供的参数为早期结果，仅供测试代码是否存在错误。在训练过程中，可以尝试更改不同的车辆数目进行二次训练，车辆数目的改变会使智能体学习到更复杂的信道占用情况时的结果。最后，我们的代码测试时其实发现一些问题还未解决，首先，训练时自动转入测试阶段取得的结果不如直接运行测试部分取得的结果。第二，我们统计智能体给所有车辆分配动作之后的信道占用情况，发现大多数时候只占用了19个信道，这还需要进一步分析。最后，感谢您关注到我们的研究，在复现或参考过程中如果遇到问题可以通过邮箱与我们取得联系，我们将尽可能清晰的阐明现有的工作。
